## Description

<p>This is a repository where I save music that I've recorded to use in different projects.</p>
<p>The songs were all recorded using <b>Studio One</b> for the recordings, <b>Audacity</b> for quick editing and <b>Bosca Ceoil</b> here and there to make the songs with an 8-bit feel.</p>
<p>The songs files are hosted here on github on the music folder, as well as the <b>Soundcloud</b> link to allow for a quick peek on the songs.</p>
